## Project environment

[![Build Status](https://github.com/simplezhli/flutter_deer/workflows/flutter_deer%20driver/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/simplezhli/flutter_deer/actions?query=workflow%3A%22flutter_deer+driver%22+branch%3Amaster)

    1. Flutter version 2.5.2

    2. Dart version 2.14.3

## Precautions

- iOS can execute commands `flutter build ios` to create `release` versions. Android can execute commands `flutter build apk` to create `release` versions.

- If there is a problem with the project, you can try to find a solution in the [iOS problem summary](./docs/iOS问题汇总.md) and [Android problem summary](./docs/Android问题汇总.md).

- Due to some plug-ins, this project has imperfect support on the Windows and macOS. Those who are interested can run the experience by themselves.
        
- You can execute integration test commands to `flutter drive --target=test_driver/driver.dart` view function demonstrations.

- I have added a relative path to the design drawings in the page notes. I can search or find the corresponding page. I hope it will help you.

- This project uses the [FlutterJsonBeanFactory](https://github.com/zhangruiyu/FlutterJsonBeanFactory) plugin to generate beans.
